            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>Whitlock,</hi> Obſerv. p. 358, 359.</note> Our Proteſtant Jeſuites care not for converting the Indians that have no gold; they know how to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weave the pretence of Gods intereſt with their own, and therewith to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance all their deſignes. Indeed theſe Jeſuites carry not the Goſpel into any beggerly Region; ſpring a mine, and then if you will ſet up a pulpit, and ſhew them gold there, they will barter ſalvation: otherwiſe, no penny, no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-noſter. <hi>Again,</hi> Our Fiſhers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle for no fiſh, but ſuch as have money in their mouths; they will only fiſh for ſuch as contribute to their ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, When I conſider what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous teſtimonies the LORDS-WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THIES have left behind them of their faithfulneſs and great zeal unto the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe of Chriſt, not only ſpeaking againſt the corruptions and abuſes of their times: (For had they done no more, what had we known now of the Hypocriſie and Apoſtacy of Profeſſors then?) but have left behinde them (in white and black, as we ſay.)</hi> Living Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents <hi>of their Love to God and his
<pb facs="tcp:42670:6"/> people. Truly this takes very much with me, and exceedingly condemns the neglect and backwardneſs of this age. I am thinking many times when, an</hi> AF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER-GENERATION <hi>ſhall hear of this</hi> Second Apoſtacy, <hi>and how far it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the former, in breaking Oaths, Vows, and Ingagements, and the name of God and Religion more diſhonored by</hi> Church-members, <hi>and</hi> Church-Officers, <hi>and other</hi> Profeſſors, <hi>then ever before in any age; how ſtrange it would be to them, and admir'd, if nothing ſhould come to their hands from us, as there doth to our hands from the</hi> Witneſſes <hi>before us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beſides, I am now an</hi> old man, <hi>and expect every day to lay down this</hi> earthly Tabernable; <hi>it will be therefore ſome comfort to me, whenſoever my</hi> change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coms, <hi>that I have left a</hi> PUBLICK TESTIMONY <hi>againſt this</hi> preſent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy, <hi>as formerly I did against the other: and howſoever I bleſs the Lord that hath kept my feet out of the</hi> SNARE <hi>of both, yet this I ſhall leave behind me under my hand,</hi> i. e. The Free Grace, and Goodneſs of God, hath more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly appeared towards me, in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me a poor worm, from this Laſt
<pb facs="tcp:42670:7"/> Apoſtacy, then from the former: not onely becauſe of the two, I take the Laſt to be the worſt; but becauſe the later hath in it much more of the depths of Satan then the former had. <hi>As for their jeerings and</hi> reproachful ſpeeches, <hi>I paſs them by: ſuch things are not new with me; the</hi> Biſhops <hi>and their</hi> Creatures <hi>uſed them: yet thus much I muſt ſay for the</hi> Biſhops, <hi>which I cannot ſay for them, ſo far they ſhewed us FAIR PLAY, not to impriſon us, nor baniſh us, till they had told us the cauſe, and heard what we could ſay for our ſelves; yea, and would ſeem to be very pious and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in taking great paines with ſome of us, to bring us out of our errours, (as they cal'd it:) but I have found no ſuch</hi> piety <hi>or</hi> charity <hi>with theſe men, for I have been baniſhed now almoſt</hi> two years, <hi>but never to this day knew the cauſe of it, neither hath there been any thing laid to my charge. I ſhall not ſpeak of the ſad calamity which they have brought ſince upon my Family, by the death of my dear wife and daughter. Again, for the</hi> Biſhops, <hi>this I may ſay further, for many of them (I think the
<pb facs="tcp:42670:7"/> moſt part (when they baniſhed any of us, or cast us into priſon</hi> for Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity) <hi>they thought they did well, and did God good ſervice in it. Thus they were like</hi> Saul <hi>before his converſion, they did things</hi> ignorantly in unbelief: <hi>But for men to perſecute the people of God for no other cauſe, but becauſe they reprove them for their hypocriſie and falſhood, (and they know in their own conſciences what is ſpoken is very true) of ſuch men we cannot have the charity which we had of the</hi> Biſhops. <hi>Indeed they are like</hi> Saul <hi>too, but it is another</hi> Saul, i. e. <hi>that</hi> Saul <hi>which perſecuted</hi> David, <hi>ONE who knew he did not well in it, but acted againſt his light and conſcience.</hi>

Indeed to know what I do (in reſpect of ſo many good men diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from me) would very much diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me from ingaging again in the ſame thing; but that I have more encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment TO HOLD FAST then I think

               <p>The groaning of Hypocrites, is like the drawing of a <hi>Curtain,</hi> whereby things are hid and covered: The more they weep, faſt, and pray, the leſs fight have they of their ſins: For what is the reaſon ſome men ſee not ſo much evil in their wayes, now as they did ſome yeers paſt?

                  <hi>the woman of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> met with, when ſhe beſought Chriſt for her daughter: 1. Chriſt goes away from her, as if he would not hear her: when ſhe had followed him, and gotten a word from him, what was it? truly a hard ſaying, <hi>He is not ſent unto ſuch as ſhe.</hi> Well, ſhe faints not, neither is weary, but continues her cry, <hi>Lord, Lord, have mercy upon me.</hi> VVhat follows next? that her requeſt was unſeemly, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, <hi>viz. To caſt Childrens bread to Dogs.</hi> A man would think whilſt Chriſt carried himſelf thus towards her, it was no <hi>time of finding;</hi> whereas in truth ſhe found him all the while: I ſay, all this time that theſe diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and temptations lay upon her, it was A TIME OF FINDING. But you will ſay, How? I anſwer, both
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42670:94"/> in keeping up her ſoul, that ſhe fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not; and in making way for the diſcovery of that <hi>great faith,</hi> which he gave her. So that it was better for the woman that ſhe was defer'd a while and ſtrengthened in the work, then to have had her requeſt ſooner granted. To you therefore my Brethren and Companions in Tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jeſus Chriſt, this I would humbly ſend to you: whereas the Lord hath ſtrengthned you in mourning and crying againſt the <hi>Abominations of the laſt Apoſtacie;</hi> it is not onely matter of comfort to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you that there hath been <hi>a time of finding;</hi> but alſo (and note it well) there is a bleſſing in it, and much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love: Oh it is love indeed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, when the Lord draws from us abundance of tears and groans, and enables us to wait long before he gives the bleſſing.</p>
               <p>A word likewiſe to our DISSEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TING-BRETHREN, whoſe mourning of late is turned into laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and their heavineſs to joy. <hi>Joſephs afflictions</hi> are no more remembred, neither the oppreſſion and cry of the
